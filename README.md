# Dessert Flavor Combinations
The goal here is predict what flavor combinations make for a good dessert. E.g. history tells us apple, cinammon, and nutmeg pair well because a large number of recipies use these flavors and these recipies are generally well rated. Here, I attempt to do this with a data set scrapped from epicurious.com. Basically, the features are a list of flavors present in the recipie and the target is the rating (0 to 4 stars)

Currently, I am getting an error of about 0.5 stars.
